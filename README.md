# Twezeel
A simple Twitter app that can post tweets, search and show user data (including most active hours) and show you your own tweets, responses and direct messages.

# Contributions
This is a personal portfolio project, meant to showcase my current programming abilities. As such, any changes to the main branch or any other branches will only be made by me, and unfortunately I can't accept any pull requests. However, please feel free to fork it and use the code as you please (to make improvements or to use as a base for your own app, or anything that comes to mind!). This app is fairly simple, so meddling with its code might be a nice way to learn for beginner programming students (especially people taking online courses - just remember to always follow academic honesty, and not use this app as your homework assignment!). Crediting after use will be very welcome!

# Building blocks
- Flask
- Bootstrap
- Twython (https://twython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) - Python wrapper for Twitter's API
- Jinja2 - templating language for dynamic HTML pages
- Plotly - for activity time chart
- jQuery - for event based functions like tweet character counter or on-click data loading to save bandwith/speed up page loading time
- Twemoji Picker (https://github.com/xLs51/Twemoji-Picker) - emoji selector for tweet text field
